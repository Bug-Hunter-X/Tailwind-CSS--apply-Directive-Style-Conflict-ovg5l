This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with the `@apply` directive and a class that has conflicting or overlapping styles.  For instance:

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700;
  background-color: red; /* Conflicting style */
}
```

The `background-color: red;` directly overrides the styles applied by `@apply`.  Tailwind's `@apply` essentially inlines CSS classes; it doesn't have a higher priority than other styles declared directly within the element's styles.
